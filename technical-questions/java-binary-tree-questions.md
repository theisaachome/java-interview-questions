4. Binary Tree Interview Questions
   the tree data structure is another famous data structure in programming interviews. It has several variants, e.g., a binary tree, search tree, and even binary heaps. It's almost guaranteed to see a couple of binary tree questions in programming job interviews.

Here is a list of some of the popular binary tree interview questions from programming job interviews:

35. Implement a binary search tree? (solution)

36. Pre-order traversal in a given binary tree? (solution)

37. Traverse a given binary tree in Pre-order without recursion (solution)

I38. mplement a Post-order traversal algorithm? (solution)

39. Traverse a binary tree in Postorder traversal without recursion (solution)

40. Print all leaves of a binary search tree? (solution)

41. Count many leaf nodes in a given binary tree? (solution)

42. In order traversal in given binary tree? (solution)

43. Print all nodes of given binary tree using inorder traversal without recursion (solution)

44. Check if a given binary tree is a binary search tree? (solution)

45. Check if a binary tree is balanced or not? (solution)

46. Given a binary search tree, how do you check whether there are two nodes in it whose sum equals a given value? (solution)

47. Convert a binary search tree to a sorted doubly-linked list. you are only allowed to change the target of pointers but cannot create any new nodes. (solution)

48. Given a binary search tree and a value k, How do you find a node in the binary search tree whose value is closest to k. (solution)
